; This pattern tests for the absence of the string "SMTP" to determine whether CVE-2019-3823 or its
; patch has been compiled out.

; Info about the CVE: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/39df4073e5413fcdbb5a38da0c1ce6f1c0ceb484
; Summary: This CVE involves a buffer overflow vulnerability while using the strtol function. A
; string is passed into the strtol function, but if no null terminator is present within the
; string's buffer, strtol will overread the buffer.

; The vulnerability and patch for CVE-2019-3823 is located in the #ifndef CURL_DISABLE_SMTP
; preprocessor directive in smtp.c. The string "#HttpOnly_" is also located only inside this
; directive, so therefore, if this string is not in the binary, then neither the vulnerability
; (nor fix) would exist in the binary.

`=0x4d`
`=0x54`
`=0x50`
`=0x00`
