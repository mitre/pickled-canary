; This pattern tests for the absence of the string "#HttpOnly_" to determine whether CVE-2015-3145
; or its patch has been compiled out.

; Info about the CVE: https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/b5f947b8ac0e282c61c75b69cd5b9d37dafc6959
; Summary: A cookie path is passed into a function, and the first character is removed if it is a
; double quote. It then checks if the last character (strlen(new_path) - 1) is a double quote and
; sets the last character to 0 if so. If a single double quote is passed in as the cookie path, the
; last character's index would be calculated as -1.

; The vulnerability and patch for CVE-2015-3145 is located in the
; #if !defined(CURL_DISABLE_HTTP) && !defined(CURL_DISABLE_COOKIES) preprocessor directive in
; cookie.c. The string "#HttpOnly_" is also located only inside this directive, so therefore, if
; this string is not in the binary, then neither the vulnerability (nor fix) would exist in the
; binary.
